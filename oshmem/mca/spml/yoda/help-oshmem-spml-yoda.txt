[eager_limit_too_small]
The "eager limit" MCA parameter in the %s BTL was set to a value which
is too low for Open SHMEM to function properly.  Please re-run your job
with a higher eager limit value for this BTL; the exact MCA parameter
name and its corresponding minimum value is shown below.

  Local host:              %s
  BTL name:                %s
  BTL eager limit value:   %d (set via btl_%s_eager_limit)
  BTL eager limit minimum: %d
  MCA parameter name:      btl_%s_eager_limit 

[internal_oom_error]
'%s' operation failed. Unable to allocate buffer, need %d bytes.
Try increasing 'spml_yoda_bml_alloc_threshold' value or setting it to '0' to
force waiting for all puts completion.

  spml_yoda_bml_alloc_threshold: %d
